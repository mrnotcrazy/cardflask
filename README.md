# cardflask
 This is a basic card playground 
 
 Features: 
 Load cards from a local folder OR better yet load them from a Imgur album so <s>I can save money on hosting </s> you can load any deck or card collection. 
 Share decks and card collection
 There is a URL shortener as part of the sharing but if you never made one you could steal that code from this project. 

To see a live demo on a desktop visit cards.benknutson.net:8080
